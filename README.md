Using more intermediate JavaScript to create a password generator

## Description

For this challenge my motivation was to use more complex JavaScript to produce a password generator that gave the user/s a random password that would be strong. This uses prompts like using a special, numeric, lower case and upper case characters to produce their unique password. I built this project to further showcase my skill set and how I would apply what we have learnt so far, while meeting the grading requirements. This gives people a place where they can generate multiple passwords that will be random and secure if they wished to use it. With this task I learnt more about for loops, how the syntax of JavaScript should flow and how to be more specific when it comes to telling JavaScript what to do, for example when to react to certain prompts. In future I would like to add in a 'copy link' element so that when someone uses this generator they can clip it to there board and paste it into their selected feild easier.

## Installation

At the top of this README.md there is a URL. This will also be accessible via GitHub so choose the platform you are more comfortable with. Once the URL is open click the 'generate password' button for your first prompt and continue until you get a password at your desired length with special, numeric, lower and upper character.

## Usage

This is to generate multiple random passwords. Please follow the steps above to use this. I would also right click, inspect and look at what is printed in the console also.
